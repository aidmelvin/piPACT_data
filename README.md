# piPACT_data

This repository contains data that I collected for the MIT piPACT project of July 2020. The data is in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.
Also, here is a link to the data in the form of Google Sheets:

Additionally, it contains the code that I wrote to analyze the data with a neural network and try to predict "too close for too long."
